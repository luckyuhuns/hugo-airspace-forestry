  title: About Us
  description: I teach individuals, business owners how to build mobile responsive
    and search engine optimized websites that tells brands story accurately. For those
    that feels "nah... web design ain't for me", I build high converting custom websites
    for individuals and businesses.
  content: "Here are some important statistics that might interest you. 80% of people
    who search for local businesses on their mobile phones will either call or go
    to that business within 24hours. Also 50.48% of web traffic came from mobile in
    2020. \nSo it's not just having an online presence that matters, but having a
    mobile responsive site that is user friendly and accessible to search engine bots
    that makes the difference in achieving a brand's online goals or not."
