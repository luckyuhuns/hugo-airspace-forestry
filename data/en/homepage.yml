  description: 'I started out as a graphic designer, and then transitioned to web
    design when i noticed allot of my clients wanted more than an engaging social

  content: "They wanted their business to look more professional. They wanted popup
    forms to collect leads, they wanted to sell online, they wanted a blog (they've
    heard content marketing is the future marketing), they wanted to send out newsletters
    too as the big brands do. in all,  they wanted a home where all their marketing
    efforts will converge. \n\nHaving racked up a good amount of years in digital
    designs, with a good eye for layout, colour, & typography. I regularly saw a disconnect
    between the mobile and desktop versions of most of my client's new websites. \n"

  content: "I teach individuals, business owners how to build mobile responsive and
    search engine optimized websites that tells brands story accurately. \n\nFor those
    that feels \"nah... web design ain't for me\", I build high converting custom
    websites for individuals and businesses too.\n\nHere are some important statistics
    that might interest you. 80% of people who search for local businesses on their
    mobile phones will either call or go to that business within 24hours. Also 50.48%
    of web traffic came from mobile in 2020. \n\nSo it's not just about having a website,
    but having a website Mobile and desktop responsive, user friendly to humans, and
    accessible to search engine bots. \n\nThese are what makes the difference between
    an awesome site and a shabby one."
