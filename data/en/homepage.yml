  description: 'I started out as a graphic designer, and then transitioned to web
    design when i noticed allot of my clients wanted more than an engaging social
    media post.

  content: "They wanted their business to look more professional. They wanted popup
    forms to collect leads, they wanted to sell online, they wanted a blog (they've
    heard content marketing is the future marketing), they wanted to send out newsletters
    too as the big brands do. in all,  they wanted a home where all their marketing
    efforts will converge. \n\nHaving racked up a good amount of years in digital
    designs, with a good eye for layout, colour, & typography. I regularly saw a disconnect
    between the mobile and desktop versions of most of my client's new websites. \n"

  title: I BELIEVE IN GREAT IDEAS
  content: "I teach individuals, business owners how to build mobile responsive and
    search engine optimized websites that tells brands story accurately. \n\nFor those
    that feels \"nah... web design ain't for me\", I build high converting custom
    websites for individuals and businesses too.\n\nHere are some important statistics
    that might interest you. 80% of people who search for local businesses on their
    mobile phones will either call or go to that business within 24hours. Also 50.48%
    of web traffic came from mobile in 2020. \n\nSo it's not just about having a website,
    but having a website Mobile and desktop responsive, user friendly to humans, and
    accessible to search engine bots. \n\nThese are what makes the difference between
    an awesome site and a shabby one."

  title: How it works
  description: "1. You contact me about the website\n2. I send you a form called design
    brief, which you should fill as best as you can. This gives me and my team a good
    understanding of your vision for the website.\n3. You will provide branding assets
    and resources like logo, company specific images (if there is any), preferred
    font (if there is any), color scheme, and website copy for each page\n4. We will
    make a prototype of what the website will look like and send to you. \n5. Next
    you send back to me your changes/updates/feedback (if any) from the prototype
    sent.\n6. Lastly, once changes/updates/feedback have been made, prototype design
    has been approved for production, main design project commences.\n"
