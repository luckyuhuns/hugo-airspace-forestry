  title: My Approach
  content: "MY APPROACH\n1-You contact me about the website.\n\n2-Send you a form
    called design brief, which you should fill as best as you can. This gives me and
    my team a good understanding of your vision for the website.\n\n3-You will provide
    branding assets and resources like logo, company specific images (if there is
    any), preferred font (if there is any), color scheme, and website copy for each
    page.\n\n4-We will make a prototype of what the website will look like and send
    to you. \n\n5-Next you send back to me your changes/updates/feedback (if any)
    from the prototype sent.\n\n6-Lastly, once changes/updates/feedback have been
    made, prototype design has been approved for production, main design project commences.\n"
