  title: Hi, I'm Licky Uhuns, I strive to <br> make awesome websites.
  content: " Having racked up a good amount of years in digital designs, with a good
    eye for layout, color, & typography. I regularly saw a disconnect between the
    mobile and desktop versions of most of my client's new websites. \n\nOn a desktop
    screen, the website looks decent (enough space, important information well placed
    on page, colors pop), whereas on mobile everything looks out of sync. Images,
    text, shapes are all over the place. \n\nIn my opinion, this was a big problem
    for those business/organization because global mobile adoption in recent times
    has been on an upward trajectory. more people browse the web (53%) on their phone.
    especially in developing countries.\n\nMajority of the traffic to these business
    websites were most likely coming from mobile. But their bad mobile user experience
    was definitely costing them a good amount of business.\n\nThis also has implications
    on the website's search engine ranking. Google bots, after crawling numerous webpages
    that match a search query, will rank webpages with better mobile user experience
    higher.\n\nMy passion for design and the urge to solve problems drew me into web
    design. \n6 years on i now teach individuals my best practices in web design and
    help businesses/organizations build beautiful, mobile first, and search engine
    friendly websites."

    content: "1. You contact me about the website\n\n2. I send you a form (design
      brief), which you will need to fill as best as you can. This gives me and my
      team a good understanding of your vision for the website.\n\n3. You will provide
      branding assets and resources like logo, company specific images (if there is
      any), preferred font (if there is any), color scheme, and website copy for each
      page.\n\n4. We will make a prototype of what the website will look like and
      send to you.\n \n5. Next you send back to me your changes/updates/feedback (if
      any) from the prototype sent.\n\n6. Lastly, once changes/updates/feedback have
      been made, prototype design has been approved for production, main design project
      commences.\n"
