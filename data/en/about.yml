  title: Hi, I'm Licky Uhuns, I strive to <br> make awesome work.
  content: "I started out as a graphic designer, and then transitioned to web design
    when i noticed allot of my clients wanted more than an engaging social media post.\n\nThey
    wanted their business to look more professional. They wanted popup forms to collect
    leads, they wanted to sell online, they wanted a blog (they've heard content marketing
    is the future marketing), they wanted to send out newsletters too as the big brands
    do. in all,  they wanted a home where all their marketing efforts will converge.
    \n\nHaving racked up a good amount of years in digital designs, with a good eye
    for layout, colour, & typography. I regularly saw a disconnect between the mobile
    and desktop versions of most of my client's new websites. \n\nOn a desktop screen,
    the website looks great, enough space, text can breath and colours pop. whereas
    on mobile everything looks out of sync. Images, text, shapes are all over the
    place.\n\nWhatever was the cause, it posed a problem for those business/organisation
    because global mobile adoption in recent times has been on an upward trajectory.
    more people browse the web (53%) on their phone. especially in developing countries.\n\nSo
    the majority of the traffic to these business websites were most likely coming
    from mobile. But their bad mobile user experience was definitely costing them
    a good amount of business.\n\nDue to the short attention span of web users now,
    a visitors will hit the back button the minute they are finding it difficult to
    navigate a website with a poor layout or if they can't find important pages (like
    Contact page). \n\nThis also has implications on the website's search engine ranking.
    Google bots, after crawling numerous webpages that match a search query, will
    rank webpages with better mobile user experience higher.\n\nMy passion for design
    and the urge to solve a problem drew me into web design. \nNow teach individuals
    and help businesses build beautiful, mobile first, and search engine friendly
    websites."

    content: "1. You contact me about the website\n2. I send you a form (design brief),
      which you will need to fill as best as you can. This gives me and my team a
      good understanding of your vision for the website.\n3. You will provide branding
      assets and resources like logo, company specific images (if there is any), preferred
      font (if there is any), color scheme, and website copy for each page\n4. We
      will make a prototype of what the website will look like and send to you. \n5.
      Next you send back to me your changes/updates/feedback (if any) from the prototype
      sent.\n6. Lastly, once changes/updates/feedback have been made, prototype design
      has been approved for production, main design project commences.\n"
